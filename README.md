OneStopPopShop is an all in one place to quench your soda thirst. Customers can choose from many different sodas, as well as a few non-carbonated beverages. These are added to the customers cart. When the customer has finished selecting the drinks they want, they can proceed to the checkout, where the price will be deducted from their (simulated) account credit. The main advantage will be the ability to buy in bulk and have these essential treats shipped right to your door. Customers can also create a subscription, re-ordering a certain order at intervals.

# How to run:

Using the terminal, navigate to onestoppopshop and run:
